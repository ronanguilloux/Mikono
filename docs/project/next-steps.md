# Next steps

**Last updated:** 2026-08-26

Only what's next goes here — forward-looking exclusively. Completed
work moves out: to an ADR in `docs/adr/` if it was an architectural
decision, otherwise to [`done.md`](done.md). See
[`docs/project/README.md`](README.md) for the full rule. For status —
what's already built and how it got there — read `done.md`, `git log`,
or `docs/adr`/`docs/brainstorm`.

## Open work

v0.1 is feature-complete (all five CRUD areas, auth, Reports view,
functional tests, one Panther E2E smoke test, scoped Infection, and dev
fixtures — see [`done.md`](done.md)). Nothing further is currently
scoped or planned. Add items here as new work is identified.

## Known conventions to not violate (see `AGENTS.md` for the full list)

- `static::createClient()` must be the first call in every
  `WebTestCase` test method, before any Foundry factory call.
- Every required `TextType`/`EmailType` form field needs
  `'empty_data' => ''` if its entity property is a non-nullable
  `string`.
- `opcache.enable_file_override` must stay off in
  `frankenphp/conf.d/20-app.dev.ini` (dev only) — it's a real prod
  optimization, but breaks live-reload under FrankenPHP's worker mode.
- Any future contrib Flex recipe (like `dama/doctrine-test-bundle`)
  gets wired by hand, not by flipping `composer.json`'s
  `allow-contrib` flag project-wide.
