# PHP-CS-Fixer Deprecated Rule Set Aliases

> **Verify against your installed version.** Upstream has shifted on
> these naming schemes more than once. As of PHP-CS-Fixer 3.95.1 (May
> 2026) the `@PHP8x*Migration` experiment is **withdrawn** — the
> non-hyphenated `@PHP80Migration` / `@PHP82Migration` etc. forms are
> the current, non-deprecated names.
>
> Always confirm by running `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer list-sets` against
> your locked version.

## Historical / version-dependent renames

These were tagged deprecated in some 3.5x → 3.6x range and may resurface
again. Always check `list-sets` output rather than relying on this table.

| Possibly deprecated alias | Possibly preferred form |
|---|---|
| `@PHPUnit100Migration:risky` | `@PHPUnit10x0Migration:risky` |
| `@PER-CS1.0` | `@PER-CS1x0` |
| `@PER-CS2.0` | `@PER-CS2x0` |

## Rules

| Deprecated | Replacement |
|-----------|-------------|
| `function_typehint_space` | `type_declaration_spaces` |

## Detection

Run PHP-CS-Fixer in dry-run mode and check for "Detected deprecations" in output:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run 2>&1 | grep -A 20 "Detected deprecations"
```

## PER-CS Versions

`@PER-CS` (without version) is a dynamic alias that resolves to the latest non-deprecated PER-CS version. As of PHP-CS-Fixer 3.54.0, this resolves to PER-CS 2.0 (`@PER-CS2x0`).

Use `@PER-CS` for always-latest behavior, or pin to `@PER-CS2x0` for stability.

## PHP migration sets — current availability

PHP-CS-Fixer ships migration sets ahead of, but staggered behind, the
PHP version itself. The non-`:risky` set follows release closely; the
`:risky` variant lags. As of PHP-CS-Fixer **3.95.1** (May 2026, against
PHP 8.5 GA):

| Set | Available | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@PHP80Migration` … `@PHP85Migration` | ✓ | use the one matching your `composer.json`'s PHP constraint |
| `@PHP80Migration:risky`, `@PHP82Migration:risky` | ✓ | `@PHP82Migration:risky` is the **latest extant `:risky` set** — there is no `@PHP83/84/85Migration:risky` yet |

**Bumping the migration set should track `composer.json`'s PHP
constraint.** A project on `"php": "^8.5"` should use
`@PHP85Migration`. If your project is otherwise PHP-8.5-clean,
bumping the set produces zero diff but sets the right gate.

If your installed PHP-CS-Fixer is older than 3.95 (e.g. 3.6x branch),
the upper bound may be `@PHP83Migration` or `@PHP84Migration` — verify
with `list-sets`:

```bash
# Inventory what migration sets are installed locally
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer list-sets | grep -E "PHP[0-9]+Migration"
```

## Verifier checks

The verify scripts should detect:

- A `@PHPxxMigration` set lower than the project's PHP constraint
  (e.g. `composer.json` has `"php": "^8.5"` but `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`
  uses `@PHP83Migration`).
- A `@PHPxxMigration` set higher than the installed PHP-CS-Fixer
  supports — the rule set won't resolve.
- `@PSR12` / `@PSR12:risky` (deprecated by `@PER-CS`).
- Any rule-set name that produces a "Detected deprecations" warning
  on dry-run (run the detection command above).

## Pre-push usage gotchas

Two php-cs-fixer behaviours make a local run disagree with CI:

- **The cache masks violations.** php-cs-fixer records clean files in
  `.php-cs-fixer.cache`; a later run then reports a file clean while CI (fresh
  checkout, no cache) fails the Code Style job on it — often an
  `ordered_class_elements` reorder that a newer fixer version flags. For a
  reliable pre-push check, run with `--using-cache=no`. (The CI fixer version can
  also be newer than local; cache-off catches most of that gap.)
- **`no_unused_imports` deletes an import you added before its first use.** When
  a `use X;` is added in one edit and its usage (a new method or test) in a later
  edit, with a fixer run in between, the import is stripped as unused and does not
  come back — CI then dies with `Class "…\X" not found`. After adding code that
  references a newly-imported class, re-verify the import is still present.
